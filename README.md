# Jxgged-Alliance-Regeneration

I want to build a python game application. On the first version the player can play a gunfight with an AI. The guns has randomly added to the player, and to the AI. Gunfight working 

#Need to code:
- Guns in class (with gun types, gun damage, loot chance),
- Player in class (with health, and name),
- AI in class, (with health, and name),
- Gunfight (with one by one fight, random miss shots).
